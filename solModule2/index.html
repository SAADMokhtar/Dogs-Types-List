	 	<h2 class="t1">Bulldog</h2>
	 	<p> The American Bulldog is a large, stocky and powerful working dog breed from the Mastiff family. They have distinctive half-erect pendant-shaped ears and a strong jaw. American Bulldogs can trace their lineage from the American Johnson Bulldog and the Scott Bulldog.Their strong legs mean they are able to jump very high, in some cases up to 6 feet. They have short, coarse fur which usually comes in white and brindle, though there are many different colours available. They are light to moderate shedders, but do not shed as much as other dogs because they do not have a thick undercoat. </p>

	 	<h2 class="t2">Malamute </h2>
	 	<p> The Alaskan Malamute is a large and muscular domesticated dog with a heavy fur coat and bounds of energy. The Malamute was originally put to use as a freight-carrying animal because of their endurance in cold climates. They are best known today as slay dogs, teamed up to cart people and cargo across the frozen tundra of Alaska.The Malamute is a part of the Spitz family of dogs. Developed by the Mahlemuitstribe of Alaska, their vast history can be traced back 2,000 to 3,000 years.Alaskan Malamutes have a thick double coat that can be as much as ten centimetres in length.  </p>

	 	<h2 class="t3"> Basenji</h2>
	 	<p>The Basenji is a hound dog and belongs to the smaller dog group. They are short-haired dogs with long, pointy ears. An interesting fact about the Basenji is that they find it hard to bark, so they can turn to yodelling instead! Basenji’s come in rich chestnut red, black, tricolour, or brindle. No matter which colour they come in, their feet, chest, and tail tips are always white.Because the Basenji has such short hair, their shedding is not very noticeable unless you really pay attention and look for fur. Very catlike in nature, Basenji’s tend to groom their own bodies. </p>
